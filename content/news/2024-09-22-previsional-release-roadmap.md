As of today, we have just introduced a [Previsional Release Roadmap](/release_roadmap) page on the website which will help you keeping track on when to expect new Mixxx releases, with a focus on new minor releases, which are the release containing all the new shiny features that the community is working hard to deliver.

Mixxx is adopting a 6-month development cycle, starting from the soon to come 2.5.0. Going forward, you should expect new release every October and April of each years, similarly to the Ubuntu release cycle. Note that this is only a guideline for the team to know on when to focusing on making a release, but quality will remain the main driver as well as depending on available of the team to complete the release process.
